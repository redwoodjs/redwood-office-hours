# RedwoodJS Office Hours Examples

Each week, typically on Wednesdays, RedwoodJS holds Office Hours for the [Community on Discord](http://discord.gg/redwoodjs).

Usually Office Hours is an open Q&A session where people can get help with RedwoodJS or find out about new features or what's planned on the roadmap.

Sometimes we'll do code example demos to showcase a feature or to answer a question the community has asked.

This repo is where these demos and examples live.
